## Overview

This module install an Icinga 2 instance with the current web interface.

## Module Description

This modules install an instance of Icinga 2 with the current web interface. It
let you define resources that the instance should monitor.

The module does not use stored procedures. The reason is quite simple, in a
perfect world, all resources in a network are managed with Puppet. In a real
world, there are a lot of resources like switches, routers, printers that can't
be managed with Puppet and other resources that aren't managed by Puppet
because of whatever reasons. So you have to define monitoring resources anyway
beside of stored procedures. Mixing manually defined resources and resources
from stored procedures is not really predictable and therefor error-prone.

The new web interface will be integrated an set as default once it is in the
stable branch of the Icinga repository.

## Setup

### What icinga affects

* A list of files, packages, services, or operations that the module will alter,
  impact, or execute on the system it's installed on.
* This is a great place to stick any warnings.
* Can be in list or paragraph form.

### Setup Requirements **OPTIONAL**

If your module requires anything extra before setting up (pluginsync enabled,
etc.), mention it here.

### Beginning with icinga

The very basic steps needed for a user to get the module up and running.

If your most recent release breaks compatibility or requires particular steps
for upgrading, you may wish to include an additional section here: Upgrading
(For an example, see http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/firewall).

## Usage

Put the classes, types, and resources for customizing, configuring, and doing
the fancy stuff with your module here.

```puppet
include '::icinga'
```

## Reference

Here, list the classes, types, providers, facts, etc contained in your module.
This section should include all of the under-the-hood workings of your module so
people know what the module is touching on their system but don't need to mess
with things. (We are working on automating this section!)

## Limitations

This is where you list OS compatibility, version compatibility, etc.

## Development

Since your module is awesome, other users will want to play with it. Let them
know what the ground rules for contributing are.

## Release Notes/Contributors/Etc **Optional**

If you aren't using changelog, put your release notes here (though you should
consider using changelog). You may also add any additional sections you feel are
necessary or important to include here. Please use the `## ` header.
